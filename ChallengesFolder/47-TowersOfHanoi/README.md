# CHALLENGE 47
## Towers of Hanoi
###### Project 4: 6/1/2022

Haven't added a any sort of winning screen or instructions because I thought that my implementation wouldn't suit the game too well unless I spent a decent amount of time planning and implementing it which I didn't want to do for this small project. Maybe later if I do this in C++ I will add these small details.

I also don't feel too good about how the pieces snap to the towers but I'm not currently sure of a better way to implement the piece movement.
