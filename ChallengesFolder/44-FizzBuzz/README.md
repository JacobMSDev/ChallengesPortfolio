## Fizzbuzz
###### Project 3: 4/1/2022

Very simple project to implement the standard fizzbuzz. The python version also contains a single line implementation despite being impractical and bad coding practicises, I simply chose to include it because I consider it interesting that it is possible to implement it in a single line.
