# CHALLENGE 112
## First-Person Engine in OpenGL

Included in this folder is only the C++ project files and none of the dependencies or visual studio files I used.
It should be noted, however, this project was developed using:
- GLEW
- GLFW
- glm
- stb_image

## DEVLOG
Entry 1:
Since my last contribution to this repository I have spent some time trying to learn more techniques and concepts that are available in C++ and learn how to improve my code structure and layout.
After spending a while working on my skills, I am now attempting to complete this challenge which will take a very long time especially since I want to complete it to a very high standard so that I can atually use it in future personal projects unrelated to the challenges.

So far, I have begun creating the basic classes that will be useful for OpenGL such as a class for the main window and shader construction and management. The goal for the time being is to be able to easily use the most important features of OpenGL so that I have something to build upon when creating the first person engine.
