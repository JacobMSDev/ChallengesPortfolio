# CHALLENGE 102
## Draw a 3D Spinning Cube
###### Project 1: 31/12/2021

Didn't do anything to consider z-order so some lines are drawn in front of other lines. Currently I'm not sure how one would do that in pygame, if it's even possible, so that might be something to research later down the line.
